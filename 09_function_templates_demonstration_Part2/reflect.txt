Template is almost like a blueprint so that when we decide to call a function, we can specify certain parameters which determine what code gets put into that and that is all determined by the way that we use that function. 
so here is a good example of why we might want to use a template is if we want to create a function that is largely going to be the same but may take in different types maybe we have a print function that we want to use to print integers so i might do something like print in value and all this is going to do is see out the value and  how it goes back.
We use the following syntax to implement a template.
Template<typename T>
The letter T can be replaced by any other letter.
Templates are like macro, but the difference is the compiler does type checking before template expansion.

This workshop was easy as my part was to just analyze the given code and understand why templates are used and how to implement them. I have been working to complete my milestone.
I will submit my milestone 3 before midnight today .
